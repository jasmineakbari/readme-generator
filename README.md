# README Generator

## Description
Welcome to my Quality READme Generator! This application allows you to generate a READme for your project with no thought required as to what goes into and what order. After cloning the project and installation you can follow a series of prompts using node.js to input all the data you want in your specific READme. After completion it will generate for you in the "dist" folder for you to simply copy and paste into your projects empty file.
